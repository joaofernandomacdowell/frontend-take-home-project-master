## Extras

### LocalStorage Pull Request

This [Pull Request](https://github.com/joaofernandomacdowell/frontend-take-home-project-master/pull/1) applies localStorage on redux store startup, saving the countries array in memory cache to prevent unnecessary requests.

It was not done in the final project solution because this it loses the meaning to make a request for the endpoint `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/{name}`

### Next Steps

- Add CI/CD pipeline
- Write more component tests
- Full layout and pagination functionality (toggle active)
- Query string pattern in Home: `http://localhost:3000/search?q=america&page=2`
- Service worker
